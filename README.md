This code uses the D-Wave Ocean SDK to solve the maximum clique problem using the Ising formulation. The dimod.BinaryQuadraticModel class is used to represent the Ising model, and the dimod.SimulatedAnnealingSampler class is used to sample from the model.

The code first defines the graph as a dictionary, where the keys are the vertices and the values are the sets of neighboring vertices. It then creates a binary quadratic model and adds positive terms to encourage spins to align for connected vertices and negative terms to discourage spins from aligning for unconnected vertices.

The code then sets up the sampler and samples from the BQM. It finds the sample with the lowest energy and decodes the solution to find the maximum clique
